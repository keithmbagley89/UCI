### Step 2: Gathering Evidence

    mv Roulette_Player_WinLoss_0310/0310_win_loss_player_data Roulette_loss_Incident/Player_Analysis
    mv Roulette_Player_WinLoss_0310/0312_win_loss_player_data Roulette_loss_Incident/Player_Analysis
    mv Roulette_Player_WinLoss_0310/0315_win_loss_player_data Roulette_loss_Incident/Player_Analysis
    mv Dealer_Schedules_0310/0310_Dealer_schedule Roulette_loss_Incident/Dealer_Analysis
    mv Dealer_Schedules_0310/0312_Dealer_schedule Roulette_loss_Incident/Dealer_Analysis
    mv Dealer_Schedules_0310/0315_Dealer_schedule Roulette_loss_Incident/Dealer_Analysis                                                   



Your next task is to move evidence from the specific days Lucky Duck experienced 
 losses at the roulette tables. 

 - The following [files and directories](Resources/Roulette_Player_WinLoss_0310.zip) contain the win/loss player data from the roulette tables during the week of March 10th.
  
   - Since the losses occurred on March 10th, 12th, and 15th, move those files into the directory `Player_Analysis`.
 
 - The following [files and directories](Resources/Dealer_Schedules_0310.zip) contain the employee schedules for all of Lucky Duck's tables during the week of March 10th.
 
   - Since the losses occurred on March 10th, 12th, and 15th, move the schedules for those days into the directory `Dealer_Analysis`


### Step 3: Correlating the Evidence

Your next task is to correlate the large losses from the roulette tables to the dealer schedule in order to determine the dealer and player that are likely colluding to steal money from Lucky Duck.

 - *Note: Any winnings for Luck Duck Casino are indicated with a positive number and any losses are a negative number.*

Complete the following tasks:

#### Player Analysis

- Navigate into the `Player_Analysis` directory.

- Use `grep` to isolate out all the `losses` that occurred on March 10th, 12th, and 15th.

- Place those results into a file called `Roulette_Losses`.

- Preview your file `Roulette_Losses` and analyze the data.

    cd Player_Analysis
    touch Roulette_Losses.md
    grep - * > Roulette_Losses
    nano Roulette_Losses

- Then, document in the `Notes_Player_Analysis` file:
```
    cd ../
    nano Notes_Player_Analysis
    Determined Mylie Schmidt is culprit. She was there at every time of loss on the given days. 13 games.
    3/10 5am, 8am, 2pm, 8pm, 11pm / 3/12 5am, 8am, 2pm, 8pm, 11pm / 3/15 5am, 8am, 2pm
    grep 'Mylie Schmidt' Roulette_Losses| wc -l
    13
```
  - The Times the losses occurred on each day.
  - If there is a certain player that was playing during each of those times.
  - Total count of times this player was playing.
    - Hint: Use the `wc` command for this value.
   
     
#### Dealer Analysis   

- Navigate into the `Dealer_Analysis` directory.

- This file contains the Dealer schedules for the various Lucky Duck casino games: `Blackjack`, `Roulette`, and `Texas Hold 'Em`.

- Preview the schedule to view the format and how the data is separated.

    cat 0310_Dealer_schedule | awk -F" " '{print $1, $2, $5, $6}' | grep '05:00:00 AM' > Dealers_working_during_losses
    Repeat this step but with a double chevron so it doesnt overwrite, with all of the times below.

05:00:00 AM Billy Jones
02:00:00 PM Billy Jones
08:00:00 PM Billy Jones
11:00:00 PM Billy Jones

08:00:00 AM Billy Jones
02:00:00 PM Billy Jones
08:00:00 PM Billy Jones
11:00:00 PM Billy Jones
05:00:00 AM Billy Jones
08:00:00 AM Billy Jones
02:00:00 PM Billy Jones
08:00:00 AM Billy Jones

    In the ~/Desktop/Lucky_Duck_Investigation/Roulette_loss_Incident/Dealer_Analysis directory
    grep "Billy Jones" Dealers_working_during_losses | wc -l
    The result is ( finally ) 13

    Added to Notes_Dealer_Analysis that it is Billy Jones that is the culprit

- Using your findings from the Player Analysis, create a **separate script to look at each day and each time** that you determined  losses occurred. Use `awk`, `pipes`, and `grep` tp isolates out the following four fields:
  - Time
  - AM/PM
  - First Name of Roulette Dealer
  - Last Name of Roulette Dealer

- For example, if there was a loss that occurred on `March 10th at 2 PM`, you would write one script that found the Roulette Dealer that was working at that specific day and time. 
  - *Hint: you will have many scripts, but only a small change is needed in each script.*


- Run all of the scripts and append those results into a file called `Dealers_working_during_losses`.

- Preview your file `Dealers_working_during_losses` and analyze the data.

- Document in the `Notes_Dealer_Analysis` file: 

  - The primary dealer that was working the times the losses occurred.

  - How many times the dealer worked when major losses occurred.

#### Player/Employee Correlation

  - In notes file of the `Player_Dealer_Correlation` directory, add your summary of the player and dealer you believe are colluding to scam Lucky Duck. 
  
  - Make sure to document your specific reasons for this finding.

    Added to Player_Dealer_Correlation that it is Mylie Schmidt and Billy Jones that have been working together.

 
### Step 4: Scripting your Tasks


You manager is impressed with the work you have done so far on the investigation.  

  - Your manager has tasked you with building a shell script that can easily analyze future employee schedules. Therefore, we can determine who was the employee working at a specific time in case losses occur again.

  - This shell script can be provided to anyone in the security department to easily do the same analysis.

Complete the following tasks:

   - Remain in the  `Dealer_Analysis` directory.

   - Develop a shell script called `roulette_dealer_finder_by_time.sh` that can analyze the employee schedule to easily find the Roulette Dealer at a specific time.

      - *Hint: You will be using a script similar to the one you created for "Dealer Analysis", except do not output the results into a file.*

   - Design the shell script to accept the following two arguments:
     - One for the date (Four Digits)
     - One for the time
    
     Note: The argument should be able to accept AM or PM.
   
   - Test your script on the schedules to confirm it outputs the correct dealer at the time specified. 

        touch roulette_dealer_finder_by_time_and_game.sh
        nano roulette_dealer_finder_by_time_and_game.sh
        cat $1_Dealer_schedule | awk -F" " '{print $1, $2, '$3','$4' }'| grep "$2" ( into the script of course )
        sh roulette_dealer_finder_by_time_and_game.sh
        0310 '02:00:00 PM' '$3' '$4'
        02:00:00 PM Chyna Mercado on Blackjack

        sh roulette_dealer_finder_by_time_and_game.sh 0310 '02:00:00 PM' '$5' '$6'
        0310 '02:00:00 PM' '$5' '$6'
        02:00:00 PM Billy Jones on Roulette

        Gotcha Billy!

        sh roulette_dealer_finder_by_time_and_game.sh 0310 '02:00:00 PM' '$7' '$8'
        0310 '02:00:00 PM' '$7' '$8'
        02:00:00 PM Cleveland Hanna





        

**Bonus:**  In case there is future fraud on the other Lucky Duck Games, create a shell script called `roulette_dealer_finder_by_time_and_game.sh` that has the three following arguments:

   - One for the the specific time
   - One for the specific date
   - One for the casino game being played
    
     *Hint: The argument does not need to name the specific casino game.*

 
### Your Submission

#### Guidelines for your Submission:
  
Move the following to the `Player_Dealer_Correlation` directory:
  - All of your note files
  - Your Evidence Files:
    - `Roulette_Losses`
